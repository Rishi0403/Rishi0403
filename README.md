With an impressive tenure of 9.5+ years as a Test Data Analyst, I've led teams and held the role of subject matter expert (SME) in Test Data Management (TDM).
My expertise spans data analysis and now extends to crafting compelling visualizations and dashboards using Power BI and Python. 
My keen eye for detail, strong problem-solving skills, and analytical mindset define my approach to delivering top-tier TDM outcomes.
